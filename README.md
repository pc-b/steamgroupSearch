# steamgroupSearch
Without the ability to be able to search for steam groups by tag, I created a program that would scrape a massive wordlist and check if the group at the specified url exists. If the group existed, it scraped the tag and group name and whether it was public or private and wrote them to a massive json file. If when searching it takes a while, that is because it has to index millions of groups and may take a few seconds.
